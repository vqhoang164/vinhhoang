        <p>
            Thank you for stopping by. <br>
            I am a graduate student pursuing Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering. This webpage is my personal project to learn about web-development from scratch. <br>
            I also want to create this page as an online resume/porfolio to showcase my backgrounds and projects in programming, robotics, or just attempt to try new things.
